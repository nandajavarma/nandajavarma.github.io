My Name: Nandaja

I can tell you one thing that even Google doesn't know: The meaning of my name.

So here it goes...

According to the Hindu mythology, The Hindu lord Krishna was born in a cave when his parents
were imprisoned by his uncle. Since Krishna was predicted to be a Prodigy one and his life was
in huge danger, he was secretly taken out of the cell by his Foster parent Nanda who leaves
his own daughter so the evil uncle would not be suspicious.

This evil uncle who hears about his sister's new baby comes for the visit, finds the baby daughter
and decides to kill her. Upon which, the girl transforms into a goddess and warns Kamhsa, the uncle
that the prodigy has already been born and will be the reason for Kamhsa's end when he comes of age.
This goddess who was a daughter of Nanda was called as Nanda-ja(ja meaning the one who was born from).

She is popularly referred by the name Maya meaning Illusion or a godly power that can transform a
concept into an element of sensible world.

Now that meaning I like. :-)
I hope and try to transform the concept that comes up in my mind to something sensible.

[Now even Google knows the meaning of my name :| ]
