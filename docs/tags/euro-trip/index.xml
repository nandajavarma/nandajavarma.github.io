      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was exactly 4 months ago, on the day after I met with an accident and&#xA;was temporarily crippled, which ironically was the day of my 23rd birthday,&#xA;I made the best decision of my life. I decided to&#xA;backpack in Europe as soon as I (literally) get back on my feet and, of course,&#xA;the consulate allows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I haven&amp;rsquo;t traveled much even with my family, let&#xA;alone solo. I never realized I even had a flair for traveling till last&#xA;year, when I had my little adventure in Rajasthan. Going to Rome has&#xA;been on my bucket list since high school. Also, a bit embarrassing to admit,&#xA;I was scared to death that my parents will get me married to someone&#xA;in an year and I will never get to travel alone again. So on a sunny&#xA;Friday afternoon of September 4th 2015, I decided, just like that, to&#xA;travel to Italy the coming December and experience the European winter&#xA;and Christmas, no matter what. Boy, Am I happy I did!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
