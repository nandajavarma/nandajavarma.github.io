      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I came across a very nifty tool on my linux system. It is GNU Project Debugger a.k.a GDB. It is the standard debugger in UNIX. It lets you poke around your program and find out what is wrong with your program, if it crashed or gave you unexpected results. It can be used to debug programs written in Ada, Java, Pascal etc.( Although I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it yet on anything other than C programs). So, yeah, it is a very powerful tool. I played around with it for a little while and it seems pretty easy. I am sure if I give it a little more effort, I sure can make best friends with GDB pretty soon. I wish I knew  GDB six months ago when I kept getting segmentation faults in my Data structures lab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
