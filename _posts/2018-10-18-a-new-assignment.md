Hi,


This is my first post of 2018. I have been telling myself that I am "too
busy" to write but in reality I just suck at prioritizing. So today I am
arm-twisting myself to write again because, I have things to say.


As an Indian and as a women I feel quite influenced by a lot of things
happening back home. Changes are happening in our very oppressed
patriarchal society  and a lot of unspoken feelings(most of which is
super-conservative) is being expresses violently and otherwise all over
the country. Which is good, because a lot of people back home who
thought young adult women entering this one particular holy shrine
would lead to apocalypse in the beginning are coming to their senses.


I have a very strange relationship with my parents. Most of our life,
both parties just agreed to disagree and most of these disagreements
where never expresses. I recently decided to express some of these and
interestingly, I was asked quite a lot of questions by one of my birth
giver about my religious/political view points.


I started calling myself a liberalist socialist and then just a
liberalist in my early to mid twenties. I still stand to these view
points, but some of the above mentioned questions made me realize that I
do not know much about world politics and just kept saying everything is
fucked up. So I decided to do a small assignment in my free time. Learn
more about world politics.


I didn't really know where to start since I
don't think I will be able to stick on to a huge book written on World
politics. I wanted something more up to date. So like every other
millennial I started hitting the Wikipedia. Basically reading about the
politics of one country at a time. I started with Italy since that's the
country where I live in atm. So this is just my introductory post on the
upcoming long boring series on long politics. I really want to keep it
all documented just in case someone might stumble upon this. After all
sharing is caring, right? ;)


Soon.
