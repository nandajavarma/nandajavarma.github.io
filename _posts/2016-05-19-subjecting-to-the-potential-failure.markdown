There are times when you think that you have hit the rock bottom of your
life/career/everything that matters just because of the huge pressure
of succeesing that's killing you from inside. You start looking at every
single person out there who thinks you are amazing and you feel like you
are failing them all. You look at every single person's success and you
feel like you have failed, big time. You look at all the awards you have
got, all the fame you have managed to get, and you realize you are never
going to live up to that again. You are so scared of even trying, to
subject yourself to that potential failure that you will have to endure,
that "your elusive creative genius" shut the door on your face.
