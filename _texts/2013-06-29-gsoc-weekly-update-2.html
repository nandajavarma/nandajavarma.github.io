<p>Coding period for GSoC has started the past week and I have been working on a very simple implementation of the proposal in C and two tiny bash scripts. My code is available here:Â https://github.com/nandajavarma/Automated-Rendering-Testing</p>
<p>The first thing to be done to test using these scripts is create a file that contains a set of words to be tested to see if their rendering is correct. Here I have taken a sample test data file created by SMC a while ago (ml-harfbuzz-testdata,txt). Now pass this file through the script render_test.sh along with the necessary font file. That is:</p>
<p>./render_test.sh ml-harfbuzz-testdata.txt /path/to/fontfile</p>
<p>This will create a file named rendered_glyphs.txt that contains the output of hb-shape function of harfbuzz, i.e. the glyph name followed by some additional numbers (which will be ignored for now).</p>
<p>Now create a file that contains the actual glyph names of the words in the the test data wordfile. I got the data from font forge. This has to be created manually and, as of now, obeying the following structure:</p>
<p>[glyph11,glyph12,glyph13,...,glyph1n]</p>
<p>[glyph21,glyph22,glyph33,....,glyph2n]</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also make sure that glyph names of each word is in the same order as that of the corresponding words in the test data file. I have named it orig_glyphs.txt Once this is done, we can pass the above two files through the executable of the script rendering_testing.c, say rendering_testing. That is:</p>
<p>./rendering_testing orig_glyphs.txt rendered_glyphs.txt</p>
<p>This script will compare the glyphs in order and if it find any pairs that doesn't match, it will write to a file, result.txt, the line number in which the word appears in the test data file. Otherwise it will tell you the renderings are perfect.</p>
<p>Once this is done, to see the words with wrong renderings we will have to run the third script show_rendering.sh. It takes as input the result.txt file, the test data file and also the font file. That is:</p>
<p>./show_rendering.sh result.txt ml-harfbuzz-testdata.txt /path/to/fontfile</p>
<p>This script will create png images of the wrongly rendered words in the current directory.</p>
<p>That is all about my scripts. But the C code is very much inefficient. It even spits segmentation faults with some files. Once I make sure that I am on the right path after discussing with my mentor, I will be working on improving my algorithm and making this code better. That would be my next week's work.</p>
