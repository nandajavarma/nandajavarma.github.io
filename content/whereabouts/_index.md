I've been working from different places for a good chunk of each year, mostly because work permits it. I'm enjoying this flavor of travel immensely at the moment — it really helps me feel like I get to live in a whole bunch of different countries. I'm particularly fascinated by big cities. Going to try to document a little bit of all that here.
