I'm an engineer who finds beauty in well-architected systems and simple solutions to complex problems. Also distributed systems and the internet's plumbing — the fact that packets find their way home across the world still blows my mind.

Currently, I help solve developer frustrations at [Ona](https://ona.com) (formerly Gitpod 🍊). My days involve infrastructure work, networking problems, systems debugging, and writing Go. If something's broken at the network layer, I'm probably the one tracing iptables rules and chasing BGP misconfigurations.

When I'm not doing any of that, I'm tweaking my Emacs config endlessly — in vim mode, naturally.

### Beyond the terminal

- **Learning violin** — grew up thinking I was tone deaf, turns out I'm not, trying to catch up
- **Language enthusiast** — I try to learn a bit of the local language wherever I travel
- **Sudoku addict** — once I start, I can't stop
- **Board games & puzzles** — brings out my competitive side (not always pretty)

### Things I care about

Politics of technology, online privacy, free software, open knowledge — these matter to me. Technology should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind walls. Communities are how we make that happen.

Geopolitics is my guilty pleasure. It's anthropologically fascinating — watching how nations behave somehow helps me understand human behavior and answer questions I didn't know I had.
