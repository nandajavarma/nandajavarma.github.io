I'm an engineer who finds beauty in well-architected systems and simple solutions to difficult problems. Distributed systems, networking, and the layers of protocols that make the internet work — I keep digging deeper.

Currently, to scratch my creative itch, I help solve developer frustrations at [Ona](https://ona.com) (formerly Gitpod 🍊). My days involve infrastructure work, networking problems, systems debugging, and writing Go. If something's broken at the network layer, I'm probably the one staring at packet captures.

When I'm not doing that, I spend a lot of time tweaking my Emacs config to make my life easier — but ofcourse using vim mode everywhere.

### Beyond the terminal

- **Learning violin** — grew up thinking I was tone deaf, turns out I'm not, trying to catch up
- **Language enthusiast** — I try to learn a bit of the local language wherever I travel
- **Sudoku addict** — once I start, I can't stop
- **Board games & puzzles** — brings out my competitive side (not always pretty)

### Things I care about

Politics of technology, online privacy, free software, open knowledge — these matter to me. Technology should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind walls. Communities are how we make that happen.

Geopolitics is my guilty pleasure. It's anthropologically fascinating — watching how nations behave somehow helps me understand human behavior and answer questions I didn't know I had.
