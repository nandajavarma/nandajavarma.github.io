A digital garden is a collection of evolving notes and ideas, somewhere between a personal wiki and a blog. Unlike traditional blogs with polished, chronological posts, a garden grows organically—notes are planted as seeds, nurtured over time, and connected to form a knowledge graph.

This space contains thoughts at various stages of development: some are seedlings, others are more mature. The goal is not perfection but cultivation.
