      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sitting near a fireplace in the outskirts of Threlkeld, a lake&#xA;district village. The view from the window is absolutely breathtaking. I&#xA;can see mist covered farms grazed by sheep, snow clad mountains, winter&#xA;struck trees, and tiny little stone cottages. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but&#xA;contemplate my journey this past couple of weeks around the United&#xA;Kingdom and Ireland and I can&amp;rsquo;t control my urge to write about how&#xA;incredible an adventure it has been. Backpacking in this part of the&#xA;world is very easy in terms of navigating your way through, but not so&#xA;much when it comes to your budget, especially when you have Indian&#xA;Rupees in your bank account(which sadly has hit its record low). But I&#xA;must say, being on a low budget made my journey 10 times interesting -&#xA;thanks to all the incredible people I met along the way who helped me&#xA;out or shared the same low on the budget situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
