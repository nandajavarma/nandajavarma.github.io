      <description>&lt;p&gt;PeARS (or Peer-to-peer Agent for Reciprocated Search, if you would prefer that) is a distributed search engine project that I got involved with very recently. It is a very interesting and ambitious idea that &lt;a href=&#34;http://aurelieherbelot.net/&#34;&gt;Aurelie Herbelot&lt;/a&gt; thought of, to make searching more secure, accurate and very much user reliant. For an official intro from the skipper herself head over to her &lt;a href=&#34;http://aurelieherbelot.net/pears/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. What I am trying to share via this post is the current status of the project, where we see PeARS down the road, how much we would love others to look into the project, and what not. Hopefully the first of many more come. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in the past 2 years. Whenever I thought of blogging, suddenly I realized the topic I want to write about was embarrassingly trivial(not that I used to write about world changing ideas before). Even if somehow I end up making my mind to blog about some random stuff, the next immediate thought would be: &amp;lsquo;Who would care?!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This made me not blog all this time, which I regret immensely. Today morning I started reading couple of my old blog posts and Boy, Was it entertaining! In some of them I was extremely naive, where as in some I was just plain dumb. As the blog posts progressed in time, I was changing in a lot many ways for good or for bad. When it ended I was so sad and so mad at myself for not blogging in the past one year specifically as this year has been one of my bests in this 23 years of existence. I have done stuff and seen stuff that I never thought I would do and see. I wish I had blogged about them right then and there. There has been storms and rains over which I rose. Can&amp;rsquo;t say I have seen the sunshine yet, but I am sure I will soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
