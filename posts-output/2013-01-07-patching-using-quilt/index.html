    <h2>Patching using quilt</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>Patch files are files used to apply changes to the source code of a computer program. These changes may be for fixing bugs or for extending functionality. Quilt is a software utility for managing patches. Quilt is highly used among Linux kernal developers for managing patches. I started using quilt when I had to patch a piece of code while I was packaging for debian. Debian source packages usually use quilt. It has been incorporated into dpkg (Debian's package manager).</p><p>So, Let's say you downloaded a debian package and found a bug in it. So you will have to create a patch and send it to the Debian developers for their review and approval.</p><p>Assuming that you've quilt installed (sudo apt-get install quilt) first step is to create the configuration file .quiltrc.</p><p>Create a file named .quiltrc in your home directory and open it up in your favorite editor. Copy the following lines into the editor, save it and exit.</p><p><strong>QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX=1
QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS=1
QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS="-p ab"</strong></p><p>Quilt work with some directories. It will create a .pc/ directory and patches/ directory. As in the case of debian packages, you can find the patches you made (Or going to make) under debian/patches/ directory.</p><p>Now we will create the new patch.</p><p><strong>quilt new this_is_my_patch.patch</strong></p><p>Next step is to let quilt know which file we are going to edit and for that the command is as follows.</p><p><strong>quilt add /path/to/the/file/to/edit</strong></p><p>Now open up the file in your favorite editor, make the changes, save it and exit. Alternatively, you can add and edit the file in a single step like this :</p><p><strong>quilt edit path/to/the/file/to/edit</strong></p><p>The file will open up either in nano or vim where you can make changes, save and exit.</p><p>Now to apply the patch enter the command:</p><p><strong>quilt refresh</strong></p><p>Now two other important commands while we are dealing with quilt is pop and push. Pop will remove a patch while push will apply it. The patches are basically arranged in a stack like form by quilt. If we do a pop, the patch we applied recently will be removed, even though we can find the patch file under patches directory. So when we do a push now, that patch will be re-applied. Commands for both these are quite straightforward.</p><p><strong>quilt pop</strong></p><p><strong>quilt push</strong></p><p>Now, If you want to edit an existing patch, Make sure that the patch is applied. That is,</p><p><strong>quilt push -a</strong></p><p>('a' as in all)</p><p>Then edit the file as required and just run:</p><p><strong>quilt refresh</strong></p><p>While we are building the package, We may want to remove all the patches associated with it. And to do that either we can enter the command <strong>quilt pop -a</strong> each time we build the package or we can create a file named local-changes under debian/source/ directory containing the single line unapply-patches so that the patches will be automatically removed after a local build (Considered as a good practice. ).</p><p><strong>echo "unapply-patches" &gt; debian/source/local-changes</strong></p><p>That's pretty much the most basic steps involved. For diving in deeper (Ha! As if. ) refer : <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/modify.en.html#quiltrc">http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/modify.en.html#quiltrc</a> (Didn't help me much. )</p><p>Also there are some standards we ought to follow when we are creating a patch, so that everyone can understand it's purpose, author etc. The one I followed is DEP-3 and find more about it here: <a href="http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/">http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/</a> . It involves just some simple steps when we add some line in the beginning of our patch file like - Description, Author, Forwarded, Date modified, etc.</p><p>And do not forget to let git know all the changes you've made, if you are using git.</p>
